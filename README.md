# pypixpile
"Python library" for vector graphics with symbols in the terminal.

## You can draw everything (almost nothing)
1. *Rectangles* (**NEW!** Rectangle borders only and filled)
2. *Ellipses* (**NEW!** Ellipse borders only and filled)
3. *Lines* (**NEW!** Rewrote the algorithm taking into account my implementation in c#!)
4. *Single pixels*
5. *You can also check for collisions*
6. **NEW!** Added *coloring function* and changed each drawing function to support two colors for coloring (foreground and background, there are also two coloring functions for different purposes)
7. **NEW!** Added *cursor movement* function
8. **NEW!** Added the ability to use some *constants*, such as CLR to clear the screen and CLR to clear the color settings.
9. **NEW!** You can also use *ESC constant* to change the ANSI ESC code if you are having trouble displaying the color and moving the cursor.
